## 1. Getting started
Fork this repo and then `git clone` your forked repo to your computer. Run `npm install` in the root directory. Run the app in the development mode with `npm start` in the root directory, this will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## 2. Challenge
This challenge should be build with React and Redux under the use of best practices, architecture and smart use of ES6 features. The [dogs API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/‚Äã) should be used to retrieve the data.

In the first task the API should be called to retrieve the list of all dog breeds. With the use of this API all breeds of dogs should be retrieved and saved to the Redux store. There was no need to retrieve as well the sub-breeds lists. 

In the second step the dogs should be counted. Everybody can submit one or multiple images of his dog while mention the breed name to the API, that is an open-source. In the calculation should be counted and saved the amount of images that were uploaded for each breed. 

In the third and last step the results should be displayed in a pie chart. Due to the fact that actual 90 different breeds exist, the display of the results should be limited to ten. Therefore the ten breeds with the most uploaded images should be shown in the chart. In each peace of the pie chart should be seen as well the percentage of images that were uploaded for this breed measured on the total amount of images from all 90 breeds.

## 3. Testing solution
To test the functionality of Redux, run `npm test test/actions.test.js` and afterwards `npm test test/reducers.test.js` in the root directory of this repo.

### 4.1. Decisions
In this challenge I went for the development of the app for React and Redux, because this is not just your favourite library or framework, but as well mine.  

I started with a simple React app and the use of the React Hook useState(), to ensure that the fetch request to the API works correctly. 

With the implantation of Redux I decided to move all the related code reps. files into a separate Redux folder.  To start with Redux I created as a first step the store. In the next step I defined the action and the reducer for the fetch of all dog breeds. As I completed this step successfully, I moved on to define a new fetch request to get the amount of images for each breed. I combined the results of the two fetches in one object with two keys, one for the breed name  and the other one for the amount of images. The reason behind this decision was that I wanted to have just one object for each breed that holds all the needed information. 

To ensure a robust app I decided to add an error handling in the Main component and in the API client.  To display the data in a nice way I decided to use React Chart.js, because I liked to design. I added as well a loader, to ensure if there is any delay in the display of the data, the loader can be shown and the user knows that he have to wait a moment.

### 4.2. Prospects
If I would have more time I would like to implement the functionality to display all or a set amount of the images of each breed. 

I also would like to implement a vote for each image. 

Another functionality that I would like to implement is a search bar, where I can search for my favourite breed.
